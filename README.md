#Finding Gold


We ran a basic Logistic Regression to predict whether we will find Gold based on Antimony levels at 64 different locations.


After running our Regression we discovered the following:
 - Antimony levels by location are a significant predictor of finding gold based on our model
 - Our model is inherently flawed. Our sample size is not quite large enough to give an authentic prediction.
 - For instance, our model shows that as antimony levels increase, by location, our chance of finding gold increases by 176%
 - Further data should be gathered before making a final prediction, however, we are close to having a proper model
